🛡️ Phishing Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements several machine learning models to classify websites as phishing or legitimate based on extracted features from a dataset.

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset file must be named `dataset.csv`.
- It should contain a target column named `Result` or `label`.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-detector.git
   cd phishing-detector
(Optional) Create a virtual environment:
